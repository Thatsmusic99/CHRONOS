# Ontime-Reimagined
OnTime was originally a plugin made by Edge209 on the [Bukkit dev website.](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/ontime) However, due to prolonged activity from the original developer, I have decided to redevelop the plugin rather than create a new one due to how much some server owners may rely on it whilst not wanting to migrate to another plugin.
